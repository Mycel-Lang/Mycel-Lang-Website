# Error E1002: Incorrect number of arguments for a function

## Summary

This error occurs when you call a function with a different number of arguments than its definition specifies.

---

## The Problem

When you define a function, you specify the exact number of arguments it requires. Calling that function with too few or too many arguments is an error because the function doesn't know how to handle the mismatch.

```mycel
fn greet(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
  @print("Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName);
}

// Called with only one argument, but it needs two.
@greet("Jane")

// Called with three arguments, but it only accepts two.
@greet("John", "Doe", "Sr.")
```

## The Solution

Call the function with the exact number of arguments specified in its definition.

```mycel
fn greet(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
  @print("Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName);
}

// Call the function with the correct number of arguments.
@greet("Jane", "Doe")
```

## Detailed Explanation

Each parameter in a function's definition is a named "slot" that must be filled when the function is called. When you call `@greet("Jane")`, the compiler places `"Jane"` in the `firstName` slot, but it finds that the `lastName` slot is empty. It cannot guess what you wanted to put there (an empty string? a default value?), so it reports an error.

Similarly, if you call `@greet("John", "Doe", "Sr.")`, the compiler fills the `firstName` and `lastName` slots, but then it has an extra argument, `"Sr."`, with no slot to put it in. This is also an error.

Mycel requires an exact match between the number of arguments in the function call and the number of parameters in the function definition. This strictness helps prevent common bugs and makes code easier to reason about.

If you get this error, check the function's definition to see how many arguments it requires and adjust your function call to match.

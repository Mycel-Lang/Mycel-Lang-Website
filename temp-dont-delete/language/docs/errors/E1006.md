# Error E1006: Operation on incompatible types

## Summary

This error occurs when you try to perform an operation, such as addition or multiplication, on two values whose types are not compatible with that operation.

---

## The Problem

Operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` are defined to work on specific types of data. For example, you can add two numbers, but you cannot meaningfully add a number to a table or a string to a boolean. Attempting to do so will result in this error.

```mycel
// Trying to add a string and a number.
let result = "Hello" + 5;

// Trying to multiply a boolean and a number.
let value = true * 10;
```

## The Solution

Ensure that you only perform operations on values of compatible types. You may need to convert one of the values to a different type.

```mycel
// Concatenate two strings.
let result = "Hello" + " world";

// Add two numbers.
let value = 5 + 10;

// If you need to combine a string and a number, convert the number to a string first.
let text = "The value is: " + toString(5);
```

## Detailed Explanation

Mycel is a strongly-typed language, which means it is strict about how different types of data can interact. This strictness helps prevent a class of bugs that are common in more loosely-typed languages, where operations on incompatible types might produce unexpected results (like `"5" + 1` resulting in `"51"` or `6` depending on the language).

Mycel disallows these ambiguous operations entirely. The `+` operator, for example, is defined for two numbers (addition) and for two strings (concatenation). It is *not* defined for a string and a number. When the compiler sees an expression like `"Hello" + 5`, it doesn't know which operation you intended. Did you want to convert `5` to a string and concatenate, or did you want to parse `"Hello"` as a number and add them?

Instead of guessing, the compiler forces you to be explicit by reporting error `E1006`. To resolve the error, you must clarify your intent by manually converting one of the types to be compatible with the other, for example by using a built-in function like `toString()` or `toNumber()`.

# Error E0005: Malformed Block ID

## Summary

This error occurs when a Block ID does not follow the correct syntax, such as containing spaces or invalid characters.

---

## The Problem

A Block ID is created by adding a caret (`^`) followed by a unique ID string to the end of a block. This ID string has strict rules: it must be a single, contiguous string and can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), and underscores (`_`).

```mycel
// Block ID with a space.
This is a paragraph with a ^bad block id.

// Block ID with an invalid character.
This is another paragraph with a ^bad!id.
```

## The Solution

Ensure your Block IDs are a single string with no spaces and only contain valid characters.

```mycel
// A valid Block ID.
This is a paragraph with a ^good-block-id.

// Another valid Block ID.
This is another paragraph with a ^good_id_123.
```

## Detailed Explanation

Block IDs are used as anchors for the `@include` directive, similar to how an `id` attribute works in HTML. For the compiler to be able to parse these IDs reliably, they must follow a simple, strict format.

Spaces are not allowed because they would make it ambiguous where the ID ends and other content begins. Other special characters are disallowed to prevent conflicts with potential future syntax and to ensure that the IDs are compatible with a wide range of systems (like file systems or URL fragments).

If you get this error, check the Block ID that the compiler is pointing to and ensure it:

1.  Starts with a `^`.
2.  Contains no spaces.
3.  Only contains letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), or underscores (`_`).

# Mycel Error Documentation

This directory contains the detailed, long-form explanations for every Mycel compiler error.

Each file is named after the error code it documents (e.g., `E0308.md`).

These files are the source of truth for:

1.  The online error index website.
2.  The output of the `mycel-cli --explain <ERROR_CODE>` command.

For a complete list of all registered error codes, please see the [Error Code Registry](error-codes.md).

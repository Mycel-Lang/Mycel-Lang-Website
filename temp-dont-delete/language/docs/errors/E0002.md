# Error E0002: Invalid table formatting: incorrect column count

## Summary

This error occurs when a row in a table has a different number of columns than the table's header row.

---

## The Problem

For a table to be structured correctly, every row must have the same number of cells (columns) as the header. When the compiler parses a table, it uses the header to define the table's structure, and it expects all subsequent rows to conform to that structure.

```mycel
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   |          // This row only has 2 columns, but the header has 3.
```

## The Solution

Ensure that every row in the table has the exact same number of columns as the header row. Use empty cells if necessary to maintain the structure.

```mycel
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   |          | // This row now correctly has 3 columns.
```

## Detailed Explanation

A Mycel table is defined by a header row and a separator line, which together establish a fixed number of columns. The parser enforces this structure strictly to ensure that the final rendered table is not malformed or ambiguous.

When a row is found with fewer or more columns than the header, the compiler cannot know how to render the table correctly. Should it add empty cells? Should it merge cells? Instead of guessing, it reports error `E0002` to let the author fix the ambiguity.

To fix this, review your table and make sure every row has the same number of pipe (`|`) separators. If a cell is meant to be empty, it must still be represented by its space between two pipes (`| |`).

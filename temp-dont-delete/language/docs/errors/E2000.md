# Error E2000: File not found for @include

## Summary

This error occurs when the `@include` directive references a file that the compiler cannot find at the specified path.

---

## The Problem

When you use `@include("path/to/file.mycel")`, the compiler attempts to locate and read that file. If the file does not exist at that exact path, or if the path is misspelled, the compiler will stop and report this error because it cannot proceed.

```mycel
// The file "./includes/header.mycel" does not exist or is misspelled.
@include("./includes/header.mycel")

// The path is incorrect.
@include("../header.mycel")
```

## The Solution

Verify that the file exists and that the path in the `@include` directive is correct. Remember that paths are relative to the current file.

```mycel
// Correct path to an existing file.
@include("./partials/header.mycel")
```

## Detailed Explanation

The `@include` directive is a direct instruction to the compiler to find a file and insert its content. The compiler is not designed to search for files or guess which file you might have meant. It follows the provided path precisely.

Paths in the `@include` directive are **relative to the file containing the directive**, not the root of the project. This is an important distinction.

- `./` refers to the current directory.
- `../` refers to the parent directory.

Common causes for this error include:

1.  **A typo:** The filename or a directory in the path is misspelled.
2.  **Incorrect relative path:** The path does not correctly navigate from the current file to the target file.
3.  **The file was moved or deleted:** The file existed previously, but has since been moved or removed from the project.

When you encounter this error, the first step is to double-check the spelling. Then, carefully trace the path from your current file to the file you are trying to include to ensure it is correct.

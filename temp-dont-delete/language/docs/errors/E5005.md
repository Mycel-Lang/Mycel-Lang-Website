# Error E5005: Filesystem error: Disk is full

## Summary

This error occurs when the Mycel compiler attempts to write a file (such as an output file or a cache file) but fails because there is no space left on the storage device.

---

## The Problem

The compilation process requires writing files to disk. This includes the final rendered output and potentially many intermediate cache files. If the hard drive or partition where the project resides runs out of space, the operating system will prevent any new data from being written.

**Scenario:**

1.  You are working on a large project with many assets, and your hard drive has very little free space.
2.  You run `mycel-cli build`.
3.  The compiler generates a large output file or many cache files.
4.  When it tries to save these files, the operating system reports that the disk is full.

```sh
# The OS-level error might look like this:
No space left on device (os error 28)
```

## The Solution

You must free up space on the storage device where your project is located. You can do this by:

-   Deleting unnecessary files and applications.
-   Emptying your system's trash or recycling bin.
-   Moving the project to a different drive with more space.
-   Clearing the Mycel cache for your project, which may have grown large.

```sh
# Clear the Mycel cache to free up some space.
mycel-cli clean
```

## Detailed Explanation

This is another error that is caused by the external environment rather than a problem with your Mycel code itself. The compiler is operating correctly, but the operating system is preventing it from completing its task due to a lack of resources.

The Mycel toolchain catches the "No space left on device" signal from the OS and presents it as the more user-friendly error `E5005`.

This error can happen when writing two kinds of files:

1.  **Cache Files:** The `.mycel-cache` directory can grow over time. If you have many large assets or complex function results being cached, this directory can become quite large. Running `mycel-cli clean` is a good first step, as it will delete this directory, and it will be regenerated on the next build.
2.  **Output Files:** The final rendered output of your project might be very large, especially if it includes many high-resolution images or other assets.

To resolve this issue, you must use your operating system's tools to identify what is consuming your disk space and remove unnecessary data.

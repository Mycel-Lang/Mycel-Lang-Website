# Phase 1 Social Media Strategy: The Expert's Channel

**Guiding Principle:** Our social media is not a megaphone; it's a high-signal-to-noise channel for engaging peers and experts. We are not seeking virality; we are seeking credibility.

## 1. Target Channels

We will focus exclusively on platforms where our "Leaf Admirer" audience congregates.

*   **Primary (Active Engagement):**
    *   **Hacker News (Y Combinator):** The single most important channel. We will submit our deep-dive blog posts and engage in technical discussions. The goal is to hit the front page through genuine quality and interest.
    *   **Twitter/X:** Follow and engage with key figures in compiler design, programming language theory, developer tools, and academia. Our posts will be technical, concise, and opinionated.
    *   **Specific Subreddits:** r/programming, r/compilers, r/ProgrammingLanguages, r/LaTeX. We will participate authentically in discussions before posting our own content.

*   **Secondary (Content Distribution):**
    *   **Lobste.rs:** A more technical, curated alternative to Hacker News.
    *   **Mastodon:** Identify and participate in relevant tech and academic instances.
    *   **LinkedIn:** For sharing our more formal whitepapers and architectural breakdowns.

## 2. Content & Tone

*   **Tone:** Peer-to-peer, confident, unapologetically technical, and respectful. We ask questions, we state opinions, and we back them up with evidence.
*   **Content Mix:**
    *   **80% Technical Value:** Links to deep-dive blog posts, elegant code snippets from our source, architectural diagrams, thought-provoking questions about language design.
    *   **20% Community & Philosophy:** Highlighting interesting plugins from the community, sharing our core manifesto (`*Form* is _function_`), and discussing the philosophy behind our design choices.

## 3. What We Will NOT Do

*   No memes.
*   No marketing jargon ("game-changer," "revolutionary").
*   No chasing trends.
*   No engagement bait ("Like if you agree!").
*   No presence on Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok during Phase 1.

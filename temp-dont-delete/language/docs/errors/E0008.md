# Error E0008: Footnote definition without a corresponding reference

## Summary

This error occurs when you define a footnote but never actually reference it from within the body of your document.

---

## The Problem

Footnote definitions (e.g., `[^1]: This is a footnote.`) must be linked to a reference in the text (e.g., `...some text.[^1]`). If a definition exists but is never used, it is considered "dangling content" that will never be seen in the rendered output.

```mycel
This is the only paragraph in the document.

// This footnote is defined, but never referenced from the text above.
[^1]: This is an orphan footnote.
```

## The Solution

Either add a reference to the footnote from your text, or remove the unused footnote definition.

```mycel
// Add a reference to the footnote.
This is the only paragraph in the document.[^1]

[^1]: This is a now a valid footnote.

// OR, simply remove the unused definition.
This is the only paragraph in the document.
```

## Detailed Explanation

The Mycel compiler enforces this rule to help you keep your documents clean and free of unused content. A footnote definition that is never referenced is effectively dead code. It clutters the source document and can be confusing to future readers who may wonder why it exists.

By flagging this as an error, the compiler helps you maintain a tidy and intentional document, ensuring that every piece of content has a purpose and is reachable by the reader.

If you encounter this error, you have two choices:

1.  If the footnote is important, find the appropriate place in your text to add a reference to it (e.g., `[^1]`).
2.  If the footnote is no longer needed, simply delete the definition.

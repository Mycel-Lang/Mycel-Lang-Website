# Project Todos

- [ ] **Extract TextMate Grammar:** When the Mycel language syntax stabilizes, move the grammar file (`mycel-lang-website/lib/mycel.tmLanguage.json`) to its own dedicated repository. This will allow it to be versioned and published as a standalone package for use in other tools (e.g., VS Code extensions).

# Persona: Dr. Elara Vance

**Role:** Post-doctoral Researcher (Computational Linguistics)

**Background:** Linux user (Ubuntu). Spends her days in a terminal, using Vim, Python, and shell scripts. She is a quintessential "leaf admirer." She is writing a book-length thesis and several papers for publication.

**Motivation:** Her life's work is her research. The documents she produces are the final artifact of that work. They must be perfect, professional, and archivable for decades.

**Goals & Use Cases:**

*   **Complex Typesetting:** Needs to produce publication-quality PDFs with precise control over typography and layout.
*   **Citation Management:** Must be able to manage thousands of citations, cross-references, and footnotes effortlessly.
*   **Data Integration:** Wants to include tables and charts generated directly from her research data (CSVs, JSON files) without manual copy-pasting.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** Wants to write her thesis, presentation slides, and a web version from a single set of Mycel files.

**Frustrations (Pain Points):**

*   **LaTeX:** Finds it incredibly powerful but hates the arcane syntax, fragile build process, and verbose boilerplate. "I spend more time debugging my preamble than writing my chapter."
*   **Markdown:** Loves its simplicity for notes but finds it completely inadequate for serious academic work. "It falls apart the moment I need a second footnote style or a complex table."

**What She Wants from Mycel's ABI:**

*   A rock-solid, stable, and versioned contract. She wants to be sure a document she writes today will compile perfectly in 10 years.
*   Powerful programmatic access to typography and layout rules.
*   The ability for plugins to handle complex citation formats (e.g., APA, Chicago).

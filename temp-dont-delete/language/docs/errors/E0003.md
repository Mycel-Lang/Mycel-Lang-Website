# Error E0003: Unexpected character or token

## Summary

This error occurs when the compiler encounters a character or sequence of characters that are not valid at that position in the document's structure.

---

## The Problem

Mycel has a defined grammar and syntax. Certain characters are only allowed in specific contexts. When the parser is expecting a particular kind of token (like text, a delimiter, or a directive) and finds something else, it triggers this error.

```mycel
// A stray `@` symbol that is not part of a valid directive.
This is some text with an @ invalid character.

// A list item that starts with an invalid character.
- Item 1
. Item 2 // The parser expects `-`, `*`, or `+` for a new list item.
```

## The Solution

Remove the invalid character or correct the syntax for the context you are in.

```mycel
// Remove the stray `@` symbol.
This is some text with an invalid character.

// Use a valid list item marker.
- Item 1
- Item 2
```

## Detailed Explanation

The Mycel parser moves through your document token by token, following a strict set of rules. For example, when it is parsing a list, it expects each new line to start with a list marker (`-`, `*`, `+`), a continuation (`|`), or to be indented. If it suddenly encounters a different character at the start of a line, it doesn't know how to interpret it within the context of the list.

This error is a general-purpose "catch-all" for syntax errors that don't have a more specific error code. It often indicates a typo or a misunderstanding of the language's syntax.

When you see this error, carefully examine the character that the compiler has pointed to. Read the surrounding code and compare it to the Mycel documentation for the feature you are trying to use. Often, the fix is as simple as removing a stray character or correcting a typo.

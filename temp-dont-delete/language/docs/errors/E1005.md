# Error E1005: Function or variable name does not follow camelCase convention

## Summary

This error occurs when a function or variable is declared with a name that does not adhere to the `camelCase` naming convention.

---

## The Problem

To ensure consistency and readability across all Mycel code, the language requires that all function and variable names follow the `camelCase` convention. This means they must start with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words are capitalized.

```mycel
// Invalid: Uses PascalCase.
fn MyFunction() { ... }

// Invalid: Uses snake_case.
let my_variable = 10;
```

## The Solution

Rename the function or variable to follow the `camelCase` convention.

```mycel
// Correct: Uses camelCase.
fn myFunction() { ... }

// Correct: Uses camelCase.
let myVariable = 10;
```

## Detailed Explanation

While a name like `my_variable` is perfectly understandable, enforcing a single, consistent naming convention across the entire ecosystem makes code easier to read and maintain for everyone. When all code looks and feels the same, it reduces cognitive overhead and allows developers to focus on the logic rather than the style.

Mycel has chosen `camelCase` as its standard for functions and variables. The compiler enforces this rule to promote this consistency from the very beginning.

This is similar to how other tools (often called "linters") enforce style rules in other languages. In Mycel, this core style rule is considered important enough to be a part of the main compiler.

If you get this error, simply rename the variable or function according to the `camelCase` style. For example, `my_super_long_name` would become `mySuperLongName`.

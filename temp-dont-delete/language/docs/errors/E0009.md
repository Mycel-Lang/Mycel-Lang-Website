# Error E0009: Duplicate Block ID in the same document

## Summary

This error occurs when the same Block ID is used for more than one block within a single document.

---

## The Problem

Block IDs, which are used as targets for `@include`, must be unique within a given file. They are the "address" for a specific piece of content, and if two pieces of content have the same address, it creates an ambiguity that the compiler cannot resolve.

```mycel
This is the first paragraph. ^my-id

This is the second paragraph, which reuses the same ID. ^my-id

// Now, if you try to include this ID, which paragraph should be chosen?
@include("#^my-id")
```

## The Solution

Ensure that every Block ID within a single file is unique. If you need to identify multiple blocks, give them distinct names.

```mycel
This is the first paragraph. ^my-id-1

This is the second paragraph with its own unique ID. ^my-id-2
```

## Detailed Explanation

Block IDs serve the same purpose as the `id` attribute in HTML: they provide a unique identifier for a specific element within a document. Just as you cannot have two HTML elements with the same `id`, you cannot have two Mycel blocks with the same Block ID.

When the compiler encounters a directive like `@include("#^my-id")`, it searches the current file for a block with the ID `my-id`. If it finds two or more blocks with that same ID, it has no way of knowing which one you intended to include. Rather than guessing and potentially including the wrong content, the compiler reports error `E0009` and stops.

To fix this, search your document for the duplicate ID and rename one of them to be unique. A good practice is to use descriptive names that relate to the content of the block (e.g., `^introduction-paragraph`, `^conclusion-summary`).

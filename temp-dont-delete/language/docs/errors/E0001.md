# Error E0001: Unclosed delimiter

## Summary

This error occurs when a formatting block that requires a starting and ending delimiter is missing its closing counterpart.

---

## The Problem

Formatting syntax like bold (`**...**`), italic (`*...*`), inline code (`` `...` ``), and strikethrough (`~~...~~`) must be properly opened and closed. When the compiler reaches the end of a line or the entire document and has not found the closing delimiter, it triggers this error.

```mycel
// The bold formatting is never closed.
This is **bold text that goes on and on.

// The inline code block is not closed.
Here is some `code that doesn't end.
```

## The Solution

To fix this, ensure that every opening delimiter has a matching closing delimiter.

```mycel
// Correctly closed bold formatting.
This is **bold text that goes on and on.**

// Correctly closed inline code.
Here is some `code that doesn't end.`
```

---

## Detailed Explanation

Mycel's parser is designed to be fast and predictable. When it sees an opening formatting delimiter like `**`, it enters a special "bold" mode. It then scans all subsequent text, looking for the matching `**` to exit the mode.

If the parser gets to the end of the file without finding the closing delimiter, it doesn't know where the formatting was supposed to end. Instead of guessing (which could lead to incorrect formatting for large sections of the document), the compiler stops and reports error `E0001`.

This is a safety mechanism to ensure that the rendered output is always exactly what the author intended. Always double-check that your formatting blocks are properly and symmetrically closed.

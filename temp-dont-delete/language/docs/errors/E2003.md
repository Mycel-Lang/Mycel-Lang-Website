# Error E2003: Network error while fetching remote content

## Summary

This error occurs when the compiler fails to download content from a URL specified in an `@include` directive due to a network-related issue.

---

## The Problem

When you use `@include` with a URL (e.g., `https://...`), the Mycel compiler attempts to make an HTTP request to download that content. This process can fail for many reasons, such as a lack of internet connectivity, DNS problems, or the remote server being offline.

```mycel
// The domain does not exist.
@include("https://non-existent-domain.com/data.json")

// The server is down or the path is incorrect, leading to a 404 error.
@include("https://api.example.com/this-page-is-gone")
```

## The Solution

First, check your internet connection. Then, verify that the URL is correct and that the remote server is online and accessible. You can do this by trying to access the URL directly in your web browser.

```mycel
// Use a valid, accessible URL.
@include("https://api.github.com/zen")
```

## Detailed Explanation

Including remote content requires a successful network connection between the machine running the compiler and the remote server. This process can fail at several stages:

1.  **DNS Resolution:** The compiler might be unable to resolve the domain name (e.g., `api.github.com`) to an IP address. This can happen if you are offline or if there is a problem with your DNS provider.
2.  **TCP Connection:** The compiler might be unable to establish a connection to the server. This could be due to a firewall, the server being offline, or other network configuration issues.
3.  **HTTP Error:** The server might respond with an error code. Common examples include:
    *   `404 Not Found`: The most common issue, meaning the URL or path is incorrect.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: You do not have permission to access this resource.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: The remote server has a problem.

When the compiler encounters any of these issues, it cannot retrieve the content it needs to continue. It will report error `E2003` and will often include additional details from the network error to help you diagnose the problem.

To fix this, treat it as you would any other network issue: check your connection, check the URL for typos, and verify the status of the remote service.

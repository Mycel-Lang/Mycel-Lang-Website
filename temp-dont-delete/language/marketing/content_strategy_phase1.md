# Phase 1 Content Strategy: The Whitepaper Collection

**Guiding Principle:** Our content is our product. It must be as meticulously crafted as our code. The goal is to prove, through rigorous intellectual argument, that Mycel is a superior tool for thought.

## 1. Foundational Content Pillars

Our initial content will be a series of deep-dive articles, akin to a collection of whitepapers, that establish our technical and philosophical foundation.

*   **Pillar 1: The "Why" (Philosophy)**
    *   **Title:** "*Form is Function*: A Manifesto for Modern Markup"
    *   **Content:** A detailed explanation of our core principle, critiquing the ambiguity of Markdown and the complexity of LaTeX, and presenting Mycel as the logical evolution.

*   **Pillar 2: The Parser (Technical Deep-Dive)**
    *   **Title:** "Predictable by Design: A Deep Dive into the Mycel Parser"
    *   **Content:** An article for compiler enthusiasts explaining our parsing strategy, how it avoids ReDoS vulnerabilities, and why our strict syntax leads to faster and more reliable results.

*   **Pillar 3: The Ecosystem (The Future)**
    *   **Title:** "The Symbiotic Document: Our Vision for a WASM-Powered Plugin Ecosystem"
    *   **Content:** A breakdown of our ABI, the security model, and the vision for a new generation of programmable, "living" documents.

*   **Pillar 4: The Comparison (Practical Application)**
    *   **Title:** "From Thesis to Documentation: A Comparative Analysis of Mycel, LaTeX, and Markdown"
    *   **Content:** A practical, evidence-based comparison showing how to accomplish complex tasks in each language, highlighting Mycel's advantages in both elegance and power.

## 2. Format & Distribution

*   **Format:** Primarily long-form, academic-style blog posts hosted on our own site. These can be bundled into a single, beautifully typeset PDF (using Mycel, of course) for download.
*   **Distribution:** Post to our primary social channels (Hacker News, Twitter) and relevant communities. The goal is to generate discussion among experts.

# Error E1003: Attempted to re-assign a constant variable

## Summary

This error occurs when you try to change the value of a variable that was declared as a constant.

---

## The Problem

In Mycel, variables declared with `let` are **immutable** by default, meaning their value cannot be changed after they are first assigned. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental modification of data. Attempting to assign a new value to such a variable will result in an error.

```mycel
let name = "Jane";

// Attempting to change the value of `name`.
name = "John";
```

## The Solution

If you need a variable whose value can change, you must declare it using the `var` keyword. If the variable was intended to be a constant, you should not be trying to change it.

```mycel
// Use `var` for a mutable variable.
var name = "Jane";
name = "John"; // This is now allowed.

// Or, if it was meant to be a constant, create a new variable.
let originalName = "Jane";
let newName = "John";
```

## Detailed Explanation

Mycel favors immutability as a core principle. Immutable data is easier to reason about because you can be certain that it will not change unexpectedly. This is especially important in a language with compile-time execution, as it helps ensure that document rendering is predictable and free of side effects.

When you use `let`, you are telling the compiler: "This value should never change." The compiler enforces this promise for you. If you later try to assign a new value to a `let` variable, the compiler sees this as a violation of the contract and reports error `E1003`.

If you find yourself needing to change a variable's value, you have two options:

1.  **Re-evaluate your design:** Is it truly necessary for this value to change? Often, creating a new variable from the old one can lead to clearer, more predictable code.
2.  **Use `var`:** If the variable is truly meant to be a mutable piece of state (like a counter in a loop), declare it with the `var` keyword instead of `let`. This explicitly signals to the compiler and to other developers that this value is expected to change over time.

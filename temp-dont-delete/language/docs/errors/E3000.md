# Error E3000: Network access denied for a function

## Summary

This error occurs when a function attempts to make a network request to a URL that it has not been granted permission to access in the `mycel.toml` configuration file.

---

## The Problem

For security, all functions in Mycel run in a sandbox and are denied network access by default. To access a specific URL, the function must be explicitly granted permission in the project's `mycel.toml` file. If a function tries to access a URL without permission, the request is blocked and this error is reported.

**File: `main.mycel`**
```mycel
// This function call will fail if permissions are not configured.
@fetchData("https://api.example.com/data")
```

**File: `mycel.toml`**
```toml
# No permissions are granted, so the call to @fetchData will fail.
[tool.mycel.permissions]
```

## The Solution

Add an entry to your `mycel.toml` file that explicitly grants the function permission to access the desired URL.

**File: `mycel.toml` (Fixed)**
```toml
[tool.mycel.permissions]

# Grant the @fetchData function access to this specific URL.
"https://api.example.com/data" = ["@fetchData"]
```

## Detailed Explanation

Mycel's security model is designed to be **deny-by-default**. This is a core principle that prevents documents and third-party packages from performing potentially malicious actions (like exfiltrating data or calling tracking APIs) without your explicit consent.

When a function attempts to open a network connection, the compiler intercepts the request. It checks the URL against the list of permissions defined in your `mycel.toml` file. The check is very specific:

-   The function name must be in the list for that URL.
-   The URL must be an exact match (or match a configured glob pattern, if supported).

If no matching rule is found that grants access, the compiler blocks the request and reports error `E3000`. This gives you, the project owner, full control over what your documents are allowed to do.

When you encounter this error, you must make a security decision. If you trust the function and the URL it is trying to access, add the appropriate permission to your `mycel.toml` file as shown in the solution above.

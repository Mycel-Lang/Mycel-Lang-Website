# Error E2001: Block ID not found for @include

## Summary

This error occurs when you try to include a specific block from a file (e.g., `@include("./file.mycel#^my-id")`) but a block with that ID does not exist in the specified file.

---

## The Problem

When you use the `@include` directive with a fragment (`#^...`), you are telling the compiler to find a specific, addressable block in another file. If the compiler can open the file but cannot find a block within it that has the exact ID you specified, it cannot proceed.

**File: `main.mycel`**
```mycel
// Tries to include a block with the ID `^introduction`, but it doesn't exist in `content.mycel`.
@include("./content.mycel#^introduction")
```

**File: `content.mycel`**
```mycel
This is some content, but it has no ID.

This is more content. ^intro // Perhaps the ID was misspelled?
```

## The Solution

Ensure that the Block ID in the `@include` directive exactly matches a Block ID defined in the target file. Check for typos in both the directive and the definition.

**File: `main.mycel`**
```mycel
// Correct the ID in the @include directive to match the one in the file.
@include("./content.mycel#^intro")
```

**File: `content.mycel`**
```mycel
This is some content, but it has no ID.

This is more content. ^intro
```

## Detailed Explanation

Using a Block ID with `@include` is like asking for a specific apartment in an apartment building. You first give the address of the building (`./content.mycel`), and then you give the specific apartment number (`#^introduction`). If the building exists but the apartment number does not, the request fails.

This error is different from `E2000: File not found`. In this case, the file itself was found successfully, but the specific content block within that file was not.

Common causes for this error are:

1.  **Typo:** The ID in the `@include` call is misspelled (e.g., `#^intro` vs. `#^introduction`).
2.  **The Block ID was changed or removed:** The ID may have existed in the target file at one point but was later renamed or deleted.
3.  **The Block ID is in a different file:** You may be pointing to the correct ID, but in the wrong file.

When you get this error, first verify the file path is correct. Then, open the target file and check that the Block ID you are trying to include exists and is spelled correctly.

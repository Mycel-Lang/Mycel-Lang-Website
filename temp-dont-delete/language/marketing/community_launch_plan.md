# Phase 1 Community Launch Plan: The Guild

**Guiding Principle:** Our community is not a support forum; it is a guild of master craftspeople. The goal is to create a high-signal environment where our most dedicated users can collaborate, learn, and help shape the future of Mycel.

## 1. Platform Choice

*   **Platform:** **Discord**. While Zulip or IRC are more technical, Discord's modern interface and broad adoption make it the pragmatic choice for building a user-friendly "guild hall."

## 2. Launch & Seeding Strategy

1.  **Invite-Only Alpha (First 50 Members):** We will not have a public "Join our Discord" link initially. The first 50 members will be hand-picked and personally invited. We will find them in:
    *   Hacker News threads discussing compilers and markup.
    *   GitHub contributors to related open-source projects.
    *   Academic circles and university computer science departments.

2.  **The "Key" to the Guild:** The personal invitation will frame joining not as "getting support," but as "being invited to collaborate with the core architects of a new tool."

## 3. Community Structure & Rituals

The Discord server will be structured to encourage deep, technical conversation.

*   **Core Channels:**
    *   `#announcements`: Official updates from the core team.
    *   `#general`: Casual conversation.
    *   `#introductions`: A place for new members to introduce themselves and their work.
    *   `#showcase`: For users to share what they are building with Mycel.

*   **The "Workshop" Channels (High-Signal):**
    *   `#syntax-philosophy`: For debates on language design.
    *   `#compiler-internals`: For discussions about the Mycel parser and architecture.
    *   `#plugin-foundry`: For development and collaboration on new WASM plugins.

*   **Community Rituals:**
    *   **Weekly Office Hours:** A voice channel where the lead architect(s) will be available for an hour to answer any and all questions.
    *   **"Request for Comments" (RFCs):** Before any major new feature is implemented, a detailed proposal will be posted in the community for feedback. This treats the community as true design partners.

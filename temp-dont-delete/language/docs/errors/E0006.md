# Error E0006: Invalid directive syntax

## Summary

This error occurs when a directive does not follow the correct syntax, such as missing parentheses or having an invalid name.

---

## The Problem

Directives, which start with an `@` symbol, have a specific structure. The name of the directive must be a valid identifier, and its arguments must be enclosed in parentheses.

```mycel
// Missing parentheses.
@include "./file.mycel"

// Invalid character in the directive name.
@my-directive("arg")
```

## The Solution

Ensure that all directives use a valid name (following `camelCase` conventions) and that their arguments are correctly enclosed in parentheses.

```mycel
// Correctly formatted directive.
@include("./file.mycel")

// A valid custom directive name.
@myDirective("arg")
```

---

## Detailed Explanation

Directives are the primary way to extend Mycel's functionality, so their syntax is intentionally strict to ensure they are parsed consistently. The parser expects to see an `@` symbol, followed immediately by a `camelCase` identifier, followed by an opening parenthesis `(`.

This error can be triggered for several reasons:

1.  **Missing Parentheses:** The arguments to a directive must always be wrapped in parentheses.
2.  **Invalid Directive Name:** Directive names must start with a letter and can only contain letters and numbers. They must also follow the `camelCase` convention. Hyphens, underscores, or other special characters are not allowed.
3.  **A Stray `@` Symbol:** If you have an `@` symbol in your text that is not part of a valid directive, it can sometimes trigger this error. If the `@` is not meant to be a directive, it should be escaped by placing it inside an inline code block (e.g., `` `@` ``).

When you encounter this error, check the syntax of the directive on the indicated line and ensure it conforms to the ` @name(arguments) ` structure.

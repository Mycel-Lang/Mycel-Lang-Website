# Substrate Design System V1

**Guiding Philosophy:** Our design language is intelligent, structured, and opinionated. It is for our "leaf admirer" audience who appreciates depth and intentionality. Every element should feel as meticulously crafted as our code.

---

## 1. Core Principles

1.  **Structure First, Decoration Second:** The design is rooted in a flawless grid and exceptional typography. Decorative elements are minimal and meaningful. This is the visual expression of `*Form* is _function_`.
2.  **Information-Dense, Not Crowded:** We present complex information with clarity and elegance, using typography and spacing to make it feel breathable, not cramped.
3.  **Purposeful Interaction:** Animations and transitions serve a purposeâ€”revealing relationships, confirming actions, or explaining the system's structure.

## 2. Logo

The Mycel logo must be abstract and intelligent. It should evoke concepts of networks, complex systems, or organic growth, rendered with the precision of a scientific diagram. It should NOT be a literal mushroom.

### 2.1. Primary Logo

*This will be the main logo used across all primary brand applications.*

`[Placeholder: Primary Logo - Full color on dark background]`

### 2.2. Wordmark

*The word "Mycel" in its stylized logotype. To be used when the full logo is not necessary.*

### 2.3. Monogram / Icon

*A simplified, iconic version of the logo for use in small spaces like favicons or avatars.*

## 3. Color System: Dual Theme (Substrate-22)

Our color system is a dual-theme model featuring two distinct palettes, each containing 22 colors with specific semantic roles. This robust system separates foundational tones, syntax highlighting, and UI state colors for maximum clarity and flexibility.

### 3.1. Evernia (Light Theme)

Inspired by oakmoss lichen and sunlit forests, this theme is warm, earthy, and professional.

## 4. Typography

Our typography is a blend of academic gravity and modern screen-first legibility.

*   **Headings Font:** Lora
*   **Body/UI Font:** Inter
*   **Monospace Font:** JetBrains Mono

### Example Hierarchy:

# H1: The Quick Brown Fox (Lora, Bold, 48px)
## H2: Jumps Over the Lazy Dog (Lora, Bold, 36px)
### H3: And Other Such Nonsense (Lora, SemiBold, 24px)

This is a paragraph of body text (Inter, Regular, 16px). It is designed for maximum readability on screens. It pairs nicely with the classic feel of Lora used in the headings. This is where long-form content will live.

`This is a code block (JetBrains Mono, Regular, 14px).`

---

## 5. Iconography

Icons should be sharp, line-based, and have a technical, precise feel. They should complement the JetBrains Mono font and feel like part of a professional toolset.

# Error E5003: Could not read source file

## Summary

This error occurs when the Mycel compiler is given a path to a source file but is unable to read it from the filesystem, usually due to incorrect permissions or the file being locked.

---

## The Problem

The very first step of the compilation process is to read your main source file (e.g., `main.mycel`). If the compiler cannot open and read this file, it cannot begin its work.

**Scenario:**

1.  The file exists, but you do not have read permissions for it.
    ```sh
    # You've accidentally removed read permissions from your source file.
    chmod 000 main.mycel

    # Now, the compiler cannot read it.
    mycel-cli build main.mycel
    ```
2.  The file is locked by another program, preventing the compiler from accessing it.

## The Solution

Ensure that the source file exists at the path you provided and that you have read permissions for it. Use standard operating system commands to check and fix permissions.

```sh
# On Linux or macOS, check permissions with `ls -l`
ls -l main.mycel

# Grant read permissions to the current user.
chmod u+r main.mycel

# Now the build command will succeed.
mycel-cli build main.mycel
```

## Detailed Explanation

Before the compiler can parse your Mycel code, check for syntax errors, or execute any functions, it must first read the raw text from your source file. This is a fundamental prerequisite for compilation.

This error, `E5003`, indicates a failure at this very early stage. It is not an error with the *content* of your file, but with the ability to *access* the file itself.

Common causes include:

1.  **Incorrect Permissions:** The most frequent cause. The user running the `mycel-cli` command does not have read permissions for the file.
2.  **File is Locked:** Another process may have an exclusive lock on the file, preventing the compiler from opening it. This is more common on Windows systems.
3.  **Path is a Directory:** You may have accidentally provided a path to a directory instead of a file.

When you encounter this error, you should use your operating system's tools to verify the file's path and permissions. Ensure the file is not open in another program that might be locking it, and then try the compilation again.

# Error E0007: Misaligned pipes in a table

## Summary

This error, while often a warning, occurs when the pipe (`|`) characters in a table's source code are not vertically aligned, making the table difficult to read.

---

## The Problem

While the Mycel compiler can often parse tables with misaligned pipes, the source code becomes very difficult for humans to read and maintain. Enforcing alignment as an error ensures that the source code remains as clear as the rendered output.

```mycel
// The pipes are not vertically aligned, making it hard to see the columns.
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|---|---|
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |
| A much longer cell | Another cell |
```

## The Solution

Edit the table so that all the pipe characters for each column are vertically aligned. Most modern text editors have features that can help with this.

```mycel
// The pipes are now aligned, making the table easy to read.
| Header 1           | Header 2     |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Cell 1             | Cell 2       |
| A much longer cell | Another cell |
```

## Detailed Explanation

One of Mycel's core principles is **"Form is function."** This means that the way the source code looks should reflect the way the final output will look. A clean, well-formatted source document is easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

While a misaligned table is technically parsable, it violates this core principle. It creates a disconnect between the source and the output and introduces cognitive overhead for anyone reading the code.

By treating this as an error, the Mycel toolchain encourages best practices and ensures that your documents remain readable and maintainable over time. Using a monospaced font in your text editor is highly recommended for working with tables, as it makes vertical alignment much easier to manage.

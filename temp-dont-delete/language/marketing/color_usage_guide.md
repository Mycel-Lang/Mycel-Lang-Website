# Substrate Color Usage Guide

**Philosophy:** We do not choose colors; we choose roles. This guide defines the specific role for each color in the Substrate system to ensure consistency, clarity, and beauty across the entire brand ecosystemâ€”from the application UI and syntax highlighting to the website and marketing materials.

## 1. The Tones: The UI Foundation

These six colors form the bedrock of our application's interface. They are used for all backgrounds, text, and borders.

*   `Substrate`: **The App Background.** The color of the main content area or window. It is the canvas.
*   `Mantle`: **UI Surfaces.** The background for distinct UI regions like sidebars, panels, or cards that sit on top of the `Substrate`.
*   `Crust`: **Interactive Surfaces.** The background for elements that a user is actively interacting with, such as a hovered item in a list or a pressed button state.
*   `Bedrock`: **Borders and Dividers.** The color for all borders, separators, and keylines that structure the UI.
*   `Humus`: **Primary Text.** Used for all primary content, such as paragraph text and important labels. This should be the most common text color.
*   `Loam`: **Secondary Text.** Used for less important information that needs to recede visually. This includes code comments, metadata, timestamps, disabled text, and placeholder text in input fields.

## 2. The Syntax Colors: The Voice of the Content

These eight colors bring life to code and documents. Their application should be consistent to make code instantly scannable.

*   `Mycelium`: **Primary Identifiers.** Use for the most important names in a scope, such as class names, primary variable declarations, or module names.
*   `Hyphae`: **Functions & Types.** Use for function calls, type annotations, and inherited classes. This color represents action and definition.
*   `Lichen`: **Strings & Data.** Use for all string literals, as well as data-centric formats like JSON values or CSS property values.
*   `Indigo`: **Control Flow.** Use for keywords that control the flow of logic, such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `return`.
*   `Mauve`: **Operators & Statements.** Use for operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `=>`), module-level statements (`import`, `export`), and special keywords like `this` or `self`.
*   `Amanita`: **Special Constants.** Use for language constants like `true`, `false`, and `null`, and for regular expressions.
*   `Chitin`: **Numbers & Parameters.** Use for all numerical literals (integers, floats) and for function parameters/arguments.
*   `Spore`: **Decorators & Metadata.** Use for pre-processor statements, annotations, decorators (`@decorator`), and markup elements like HTML tags or CSS selectors.

## 3. The Semantic Colors: The UI Voice

These four colors are reserved exclusively for communicating UI state and feedback. **They should never be used for syntax highlighting.** This ensures their meaning is always clear and unambiguous.

*   `Success`: **Positive Confirmation.** Use for success notifications ("File Saved!"), passing test statuses, and validation checkmarks.
*   `Warning`: **Cautionary Feedback.** Use for non-critical alerts, linter warnings that are not errors, and confirmation dialogs ("Are you sure?").
*   `Error`: **Critical Failure.** Use for error messages, failing test statuses, and highlighting invalid fields in a form.
*   `Info`: **Neutral Information.** Use for informational banners ("New feature available!"), welcome messages, and the highlight color for the active item in a list or menu.

## 4. Branding & Marketing Usage

On our website and in marketing materials, the colors take on slightly broader roles to create a compelling brand presence.

*   **Hero Color:** The `Hyphae` (from Mycena) or `Lichen` (from Evernia) color is our primary call-to-action color for buttons, links, and key highlights. It's the most vibrant and action-oriented hue.
*   **Primary Backgrounds:** The website will use the `Substrate` and `Mantle` tones to create a clean, structured feel consistent with the application itself.
*   **Headlines:** Headlines should use the `Humus` color for maximum readability.
*   **Secondary Accents:** The `Spore` and `Amanita` colors can be used sparingly for secondary highlights or to draw attention to specific features on the webpage.

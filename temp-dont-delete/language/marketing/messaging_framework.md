# Mycel Messaging Framework

**Guiding Principle:** Our messaging is clear, confident, and speaks to our audience as intelligent peers. We sell the benefit, but we justify it with the feature.

## 1. Core Identity

*   **Tagline:** `*Form* is _function_`
*   **Core Value Proposition:** Mycel is the markup language for serious research and documentation, combining a powerful, batteries-included feature set with an elegant, unambiguous syntax.

## 2. Audience-Specific Hooks

*   **For the Academic/PhD Student:**
    *   **Hook:** "The power of LaTeX, the elegance of plain text."
    *   **Pain Points:** LaTeX is cumbersome and complex; Markdown is too simple for citations and complex tables.

*   **For the Developer/Technical Writer:**
    *   **Hook:** "A programmable content layer, built on a secure, modern foundation."
    *   **Pain Points:** Documentation systems are hard to extend; other markup languages are insecure or have unpredictable rendering.

## 3. Feature to Benefit Translation (The "Why")

| Feature | Technical Justification (For the Leaf Admirer) | Core Benefit (The Hook) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strict, Unambiguous Syntax** | A PEG parser with no backtracking eliminates ReDoS vulnerabilities and ensures 100% predictable rendering. | **It just works.** Your document will look the same everywhere, every time. And it's secure. |
| **WASM-based Plugin ABI** | A sandboxed, language-agnostic interface allows for powerful, secure extensions without compromising the core. | **A limitless, secure ecosystem.** Build what you need without fear of breaking things. |
| **Batteries-Included Framework** | Native support for tables, footnotes, and citations means no more fighting with incompatible libraries or plugins. | **Everything you need, built-in.** Spend your time writing, not configuring. |
| **`*Form* is _function_`** | Our design philosophy, reflected in our own syntax. | **A tool built with intention.** We care about the details as much as you do. |

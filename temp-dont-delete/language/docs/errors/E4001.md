# Error E4001: Could not resolve a dependency

## Summary

This error occurs when the Mycel toolchain is unable to find or download a package listed in your project's dependencies in `mycel.toml`.

---

## The Problem

When you build your project, the toolchain reads the `[tool.mycel.dependencies]` section of your `mycel.toml` file and attempts to fetch each listed package. This process can fail if a package does not exist at the specified location or is otherwise inaccessible.

```toml
[tool.mycel.dependencies]

# The package name is misspelled or does not exist in the registry.
non-existent-package = "1.0.0"

# The local path is incorrect.
local-utils = { path = "./incorrect/path/utils.mycelpkg" }
```

## The Solution

Check the name and version of the dependency in your `mycel.toml` file. Ensure that the package exists in the package registry or that the local path is correct.

```toml
[tool.mycel.dependencies]

# Correct package name and version.
mycel-utils = "1.2.0"

# Correct local path.
local-utils = { path = "./packages/utils.mycelpkg" }
```

## Detailed Explanation

Dependency resolution is the process of finding and downloading all the external packages that your project needs to compile. The `mycel-cli` tool acts as a package manager, similar to `npm` or `cargo`.

This error can happen for several reasons:

1.  **Typo:** The name of the package in `mycel.toml` is misspelled.
2.  **Package Not Found:** The package does not exist in the configured package registry, or the specified version is not available.
3.  **Incorrect Local Path:** For local dependencies, the path provided in `mycel.toml` does not point to a valid `.mycelpkg` file.
4.  **Network Issues:** Similar to `E2003`, the toolchain may be unable to connect to the package registry due to a lack of internet connectivity or a firewall.

When this error occurs, the build process stops immediately because the compiler cannot load the functions or resources that the missing package was supposed to provide.

To debug this, first check for typos in `mycel.toml`. Then, try to manually access the package: search for it in the public registry or verify that the local file path is correct.

# Error E2005: Attempted to include a binary file not supported for inclusion

## Summary

This error occurs when you use `@include` to import a file that is in a binary format not recognized by the Mycel compiler as includable content (e.g., a `.zip` archive, an executable, or an unsupported image format).

---

## The Problem

The `@include` directive is designed to work with text-based files (like `.mycel`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.json`, `.csv`) or specific, supported binary formats like images (`.png`, `.jpg`). It does not know how to interpret the content of arbitrary binary files.

```mycel
// Trying to include a zip file, which is not a supported format.
@include("./archive.zip")
```

## The Solution

Only use `@include` for text-based files or supported binary formats. If you are trying to link to a downloadable file, you should use a standard link instead.

```mycel
// If you want to provide a link to the file, do this instead:
[Download the archive](./archive.zip)
```

---

## Detailed Explanation

The purpose of `@include` is to embed the *content* of one file directly into another. For this to work, the compiler must understand the content's format. For a text file, it can simply embed the text. For a supported image, it can embed the necessary tags to display the image.

However, for an arbitrary binary file like a `.zip` or `.exe`, the compiler has no meaningful way to "embed" its content. It doesn't know what the bytes represent or how they should be displayed in the final rendered document.

To prevent you from accidentally including nonsensical or potentially harmful binary data in your document, the compiler maintains a list of supported file types. If you try to `@include` a file whose extension is not on this list, it will refuse and report error `E2005`.

If your goal is to provide a download link to the file, you should use the standard Mycel link syntax: `[Link Text](./path/to/file)`.

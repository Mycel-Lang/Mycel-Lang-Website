# Error E1001: Undefined function or variable

## Summary

This error occurs when you try to use a variable or call a function that has not been defined in the current scope.

---

## The Problem

Before you can use a variable or a function, you must declare it. The Mycel compiler reads files from top to bottom, and if it encounters a name that it hasn't seen before, it doesn't know what to do with it.

```mycel
// Using a variable that doesn't exist.
@print(myVariable)

// Calling a function that was never defined.
@myFunction(1, 2)
```

## The Solution

Ensure that all variables are defined with `let` before they are used, and that all functions are defined with `fn` or included from another file.

```mycel
// Define the variable before using it.
let myVariable = "Hello, Mycel!";
@print(myVariable)

// Define the function before calling it.
fn myFunction(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
@myFunction(1, 2)
```

## Detailed Explanation

Mycel uses a concept called **lexical scoping**. You can think of a "scope" as a container for variables and functions. When you use a name like `myVariable`, the compiler looks for it in the current container. If it can't find it, it looks in the container that holds the current one, and so on, until it reaches the top-level scope of the document.

If the compiler searches all the way to the top and still can't find a definition for the name you used, it has no choice but to stop and report error `E1001`. It cannot guess what you meant.

This error commonly occurs for a few reasons:

1.  **A typo:** You may have misspelled the variable or function name (e.g., `myVaraible` instead of `myVariable`).
2.  **Scope issues:** The variable or function may be defined, but it's in a different scope that is not accessible from where you are trying to use it (e.g., inside another function).
3.  **Order of operations:** You may be trying to use a variable before it has been declared later in the file.

Always check for typos first, then confirm that the variable or function you are trying to use is defined and accessible in the current scope.

# Error E0004: Invalid heading syntax

## Summary

This error occurs when a line appears to be a heading but does not follow the correct syntax, usually because there is no space between the hash (`#`) characters and the heading text.

---

## The Problem

The syntax for a heading requires one or more hash (`#`) characters, followed by a space, and then the text of the heading. If the space is omitted, the compiler does not recognize it as a valid heading.

```mycel
// Missing space after the hashes.
#This is not a valid heading.

##Another invalid heading.
```

## The Solution

Always place a single space between the hash characters and the text of your heading.

```mycel
// Correct heading syntax.
# This is a valid heading.

## Another valid heading.
```

---

## Detailed Explanation

To avoid ambiguity, the Mycel parser requires a clear separation between the heading marker (`#`, `##`, etc.) and the heading's content. This strict requirement prevents accidental creation of headings.

For example, in some contexts, `#` is used for tagging (e.g., `#bug`, `#feature`). If the parser interpreted `#tag` as a heading, it would lead to unintended formatting. The space is a simple, unambiguous way to signal to the parser that you are intentionally creating a heading.

If you receive this error, the fix is almost always to add a space after the hash(es) on the indicated line.
